**About This Project**

This project was made by me to use for my programming portfolio.

It uses React to showcase my quickly developing talents in this area. The application uses an API call to Dog API and then parses the URL to get the name of the breed of the dog in each picture. The pictures can be changed to other random pictures. The website also features a kind of to do list where the user can create a list of which types of dogs they want to get. The website is pretty simple, but hopefully shows decent command of React. The code and design was thought of and created by me, I didn't use tutorials for the project because I thought of it myself, although maybe I learned how to make the to do list from a tutorial in the very beginning of my React education, but I understand it easily now. The design is also done by me, it's not from a template.
